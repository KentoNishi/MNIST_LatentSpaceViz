# MNIST Latent Space 

What do neural networks learn inside of those numbers? That's basically the concept of the latent space. 

In an autoencoder, we see how different values of the coding layer (2D) can lead to different outputs. 

A video of this is shown below:

Choosing and changing numbers in an autoencoder also makes us able to see how a computer  can learn to recognize patterns in the data (this sentence
